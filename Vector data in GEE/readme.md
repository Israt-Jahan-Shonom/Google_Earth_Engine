# Google Earth Engine Visualizations
This repository showcases visualizations created using Google Earth Engine for specific geospatial tasks of a Geospatial Programming Course. Below are the solutions to each task along with the corresponding screenshots and necessary code links. 
### 1. Visualizing a Rectangle, Point, and Polygon in GEE
*<font color="green">Task: Draw a rectangle, a point, and a polygon in Google Earth Engine.</font>*

Geometries (Rectangle, Point, line and Polygon) are often used to define regions of interest, boundaries, or areas for spatial analysis and processing.<br>
JavaScript codes for visualizing some specific region are provided in this [link](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Vector%20data%20in%20GEE/GEE_8(1).js).<br>

### 2. Creating a Feature Collection of Water Bodies
*<font color="green">Task: Draw a feature collection of 5 polygons covering water bodies in your area.</font>*

A feature collection is a group or collection of features, each with its own geometry and properties. It allows users to organize and manage multiple spatial features within a single data structure.<br>
JavaScript codes for visualizing five waterbodies of Nazirhat using feature collection are provided in this [link](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Vector%20data%20in%20GEE/GEE_8(2).js).<br>

### 3. GEE Admin Boundaries Visualization
*Task: From 'FAO GAUL: Global Administrative Unit Layers 2015, Second-Level Administrative Units', show the boundary of Bangladesh, Chittagong division and Chattogram district.*
It contains a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script for visualizing administrative boundaries using the 'FAO GAUL: Global Administrative Unit Layers 2015, Second-Level Administrative Units' dataset and focuses on showcasing the boundaries of Bangladesh, Chittagong division, and Chittagong district.
