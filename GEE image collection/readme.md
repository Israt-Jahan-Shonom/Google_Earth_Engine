# GEE Image Collection
This repository folder contains some simple tasks related to Satellite Imagery Collection in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform along with descriptions and corresponding GEE script links.
## 1. RGB Composite Image Generation
*<b>Task:<b/> Make a RGB composite from any image collection for your Upazila.*  
  
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/GEE%20image%20collection/RGB.JPG)
This solution utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) composite image from Sentinel-2 satellite data for Hathazari Upazila.<br>

## 2. Date Capturing of Specific Satellite Image
*<b>Task:<b/> Select an image collection of any Satellite, filter by boundary and date. Finally, select an image from the collection, and print the capture date of that image.*  
  
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/GEE%20image%20collection/CaptureDate.JPG)
This demonstrates the process of selecting a satellite image, filtering it based on specific criteria, extracting its capture date, and formatting the date for interpretation.<br>

## 3. False Color Composite Image Generation
*<b>Task:<b/> Make a False color composite from any image collection for your Upazila.*  
  
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/GEE%20image%20collection/False_color.JPG)
This code demonstrates the process of generating a false color composite image for a region using Sentinel-2 satellite data.<br>
False color composites provide an alternative perspective on the land surface by displaying different spectral bands than those visible to the human eye, which can reveal valuable information about vegetation health, land use, and other environmental characteristics.<br>
