This repository contains some simple tasks along with descriptions and corresponding Google Earth Engine (GEE) code links which I have practiced.
## Converting Key-Value Pair to Dictionary and Calculate Sum of List
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Client%20Vs.%20Server/sumList_GEE.JPG)
The task involves converting a client-side key-value pair into a server-side Dictionary object. Then, the list from the dictionary is retrieved, and a reducer is applied to calculate the sum of its elements.
