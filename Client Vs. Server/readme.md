# Client Vs. Server-side of GEE
This repository contains some simple tasks along with descriptions and corresponding Google Earth Engine (GEE) code links which I have practiced.
## 1. Converting Key-Value Pair to Dictionary and Calculate Sum of List
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Client%20Vs.%20Server/sumList_GEE.JPG)
The task involves converting a client-side key-value pair into a server-side Dictionary object. Then, the list from the dictionary is retrieved, and a reducer is applied to calculate the sum of its elements.

## 2. List Object Conversion and Multiplication
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Client%20Vs.%20Server/ListMultiplication_GEE.JPG)
It involves converting a list into a GEE List object, multiplying each element by 4 using the map method, and printing the multiplied list.
[Here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/84a0c8b9cfe759c090a4f0f1f96568c2) the link of GEE code is provided.

## 3. Upazila Boundary Analysis in GEE
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Client%20Vs.%20Server/Area%20%26%20perimeter_GEE.JPG)
It can be used to filter out specific features, perform geometric calculations, and visualize data on maps in Google Earth Engine.
