# Client Vs. Server-side of GEE
This repository folder contains some simple tasks related to client-side and server-side of Google Earth Engine (GEE) along with descriptions and corresponding GEE script links which I have practiced.
## 1. Converting Key-Value Pair to Dictionary and Calculating Sum of List
*Task: {<br>
  "name":"Your_name",<br>
  "hobby":"reading",<br>
  "numList":[2,3,4,5,6,7,9]<br>
}<br>
Convert above key-value pair into a GEE Dictionary object. Get the numList from the dictionary. Apply reducer to the list and print the sum of the numList.*

The task involves converting a client-side key-value pair into a server-side Dictionary object. Then, the list from the dictionary is retrieved, and a reducer is applied to calculate the sum of its elements.<br>

## 2. Mapping and Manipulation of List Object
*Task: [4,5,7,8,,9]<br>
Convert the above list into a GEE List object. Apply the map method and multiply the value of each element of the list by 4. Finally print the multiplied list.*

It involves converting a list into a GEE List object, multiplying each element by 4 using the map method, and printing the multiplied list.<br>

## 3. Upazila Boundary Analysis in GEE
*Task: Upload upazila boundary shape file of Bangladesh to GEE asset tab. Filter out your desired upazila, and print the area, and perimeter of your upazila. Finally, show your upazila in the map.*  
  
![Model](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/blob/main/Client%20Vs.%20Server/Area%20%26%20perimeter_GEE.JPG)
It can be used to filter out specific features, perform geometric calculations, and visualize data on maps in Google Earth Engine.<br>
