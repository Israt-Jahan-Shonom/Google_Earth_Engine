# Google Earth Engine
This repository showcases use of some functions and solutions of few basic tasks in Google Earth Engine (GEE) which I have been learning from the GEE part of a [Geospatial Programming Course](https://ramiz-moktader.github.io/geospatial-programming-course/). I have tried to organize this repository in some folders from basic to advance. Hope it will be of helped!
### Part 1: Vector data in GEE
Refer to [this](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/tree/main/Vector%20data%20in%20GEE) folder.

Refer to [this](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Google_Earth_Engine/tree/main/Client%20Vs.%20Server) folder.
